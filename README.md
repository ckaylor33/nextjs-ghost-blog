Plan

- nextjs frontend with ghost as backend (ghost free tier with heroku - next will handle 99% of requests so will be scalable with a light free tier backend with ghost)
- cms backend as client wants to be able to control and post to the website himself (ghost makes this easy to do without breaking any of the frontend code)
- heroku deploy (free and easy to set up)
- disqus for comments (free tier)
